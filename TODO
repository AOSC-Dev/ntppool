 - allow changing IPs N times a year

allow an organization name and http link for each user for attribution
  - schema change
  - UI to update it on the manage page
  - Logic on the zone pages to show the organization url relative to
    the current total score for the user or some such

update use.html page (be more explicit about number of zones)

make the country zones alias to the continent zones when they are otherwise too small

implement a database_update script to make it easier to track schema changes

check that we have in_pool checks everywhere it's relevant.

de-couple the monitoring from the database (So it can work remotely)
  - API for entering monitoring results?

Change the schema so we can support multiple monitoring systems

Make an API so the monitoring systems can pull configuration (list of servers) and post back
monitoring results via HTTP (or jabber?)

Make the monitoring servers use ntpd (noselect) to test the servers 
  - figure out the magic ntpdc commands to add and remove noselect servers
    (is that even possible?)

make server page and user profile show when the server is not in the pool (50% done)

document the growth target thing

make the country zones alias to the continent zones when they are
otherwise too small
