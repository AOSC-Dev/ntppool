Convert the model classes to use Rose::DB::Object instead of Class::DBI

- New log table
  - log monitoring failures
  - log all changes done by the system or by the users

- Deletion / inactivation
  - Change the schema to have a flag for "this should get deleted" so a batch process
    can do the deletes
  - Allow users to schedule their own deletes
  - The server should keep being monitored up until the delete but stop being 
    in the pool say 3 weeks before

update use.html page (be more explicit about number of zones)

make the country zones alias to the continent zones when they are otherwise too small

make in_pool checks everywhere it's relevant.

make server page and user profile show when the server is not in the pool

allow an organization name and http link for each user for attribution

document the growth target thing

make a graph for the total server counts

check that servers that are not in_pool won't be counted in the active
server counts.

make the country zones alias to the continent zones when they are
otherwise too small

alter table zones add parent id int unsigned;
alter table zones add description varchar(255);
insert into zones (name,description) values ('@', 'Global');

insert into locations (server,zone) select id, 49 from servers;
