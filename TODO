High priority things:

  * Change the DNS system to use pgeodns (or similar) to distribute
    requests rather than than regenerating the zone.  (Better use the
    "bandwidth" setting the admins have; distribute requests to a "nearby"
    server automatically; ...)

  * Whatever else ...

After that then some of the things I have on my list are (not necessarily in order of priority)

  * Improve the scoring mechanism to better track long term stability
    (right now the score is basically based on your last couple of days)

  * Let people mark their server as "available to other pool members".
    Use the long term scores to include / recommend / ... servers from
    that list to new admins who want to join the pool.

   * Improve the monitoring system to have multiple monitoring stations around the world.

   * Make each monitoring station exchange information with each other and the DNS servers able to get the information from any one of them.

   * Make a system to allow translations of the pool website, ideally including the manage interface.

   * Deploy more Soekris/WRAP boxes for monitoring stations and "super nodes"

 - allow changing IPs N times a year

allow an organization name and http link for each user for attribution
  - schema change
  - UI to update it on the manage page
  - Logic on the zone pages to show the organization url relative to
    the current total score for the user or some such

check if the servers do HTTP redirects 
  - check for request to pool.ntp.org and foo.pool.ntp.org
  - ok if redirect to www.pool.ntp.org
  - ok if none
  - warning if redirect somewhere else

IPv6 support
  - update database schema
  - figure out if each IP is treated individually or together with the IPv4 entry

update use.html page (be more explicit about number of zones)

make the country zones alias to the continent zones when they are otherwise too small

de-couple the monitoring from the database (So it can work remotely)
  - API for entering monitoring results?

Change the schema so we can support multiple monitoring systems

Make an API so the monitoring systems can pull configuration (list of servers) and post back
monitoring results via HTTP (or jabber?)

Make the monitoring servers use ntpd (noselect) to test the servers 
  - figure out the magic ntpdc commands to add and remove noselect servers
    (is that even possible?)

make server page and user profile show when the server is not in the pool (50% done)

document the growth target thing

make the country zones alias to the continent zones when they are
otherwise too small
