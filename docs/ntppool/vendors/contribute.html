[% page.title = "The NTP Pool for vendors - Vendor contributions" %]
<h1>Vendor contributions</h1>

<h3>Commercial vendors</h3>
<p>
To keep the pool sustainable, we'll need some contributions from
commercial vendors.  The contributions are voluntary, but strongly
suggested in the interest of keeping the service available to
commercial vendors.
</p>

<p>
The suggested yearly contribution is $5 per 1000 clients (0.5 cents
per client).  For example: If your company has 50,000 devices, please
consider contributing $250 a year.  If the expected life of each
device is 4 years, that's 2 cents per device.
</p>

<p>
The above is a guideline, if your devices query the ntp servers
infrequently (for example every 12 hours instead of every hour) the
numbers should be adjusted.

<h3>Open Source vendors</h3>
<p>

If you distribute a ntp implementation using the pool, you must place
a reference to the pool in the documentation and configuration files
or screen.  If your ntp implementation is able to serve clients,
please add a note about <a
href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html">joining the pool</a>.
