Server count hits 220.  Please do not use OpenNTP as a server for the
pool.ntp.org project <i>[2004-12-15: Versions later than 3.6.1 do now properly
report the stratum, though].</i>  The monitoring system has been changed: it
now uses simple ntp queries instead of 'ntpd' monitoring servers.
{0,1,2}.pool.ntp.org subzones have been reintroduced.  time.fortytwo.ch will be
retired in the long run.  Read more in the <a

Thanks to the efforts of <a href="http://www.vanheusden.com/">Folkert van
Heusden</a>, you can see your timeserver's <a href="scores">performance</a>
over the last 31 days. Current server count: 188 - probably mostly because
Folkert got the pool.ntp.org project <a

Current server count: 115.  The <a href="http://packages.debian.org/ntp">ntp
4.2 packages</a> in <a href="http://debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> now use
pool.ntp.org per default, and include an invitation to join the pool.  A
sidenote: some people have experienced problems when trying to reach me per
mail.  This is nothing personal, but as I've been flooded by spam, I now block
some countries and some internet providers almost entirely.

Xisco Lladó has published a long article about the project at <a
href="http://bulma.net/body.phtml?nIdNoticia=1947"
>http://bulma.net/body.phtml?nIdNoticia=1947</a> - thanks a lot!  This caused
a few more people to donate servers, so that we now count 106 servers in the
project, with 10 servers in spain.

There is a <a href="http://pool.ntp.bitic.net">Spanish translation</a> - thanks
to Xisco Lladó.  Also, I have installed an automatic rating mechanism, so
that bad timeservers are automatically removed from the pool.ntp.org
nameserver (an associated <a href="#mail">mailing list</a> has also been
created). Richard S. Shuford (Sun) sent me a note about how to configure nscd
properly to work around the fact that it doesn't do proper round robin of DNS
entries. I don't recommend the use of <tt>maxpoll 12</tt> in <tt>ntp.conf</tt>
anymore. As always: more information on the <a

The project now consists of 87 servers - thanks to all who participate.  Also,
nameservers in the US and in New Zealand will be added shortly.  The <a
href="#mail">mailing list</a> has seen some discussions about monitoring server
quality - I'll have to look at this problem more detail. Read the long version
of these news in the <a

It's done!  The project is now at pool.ntp.org.  Also, country level subdomain
are being created - the biggest (us) already has 18 servers, with ch (11) and
nl (8) being the next biggest.  Due to a problem with TCP nameserver requests,
no more than 15 servers are visible at any moment in the zone.  Debian
developer Bdale Garbee considers using pool.ntp.org in the default
configuration of the Debian ntp package.  Read the longer version of these news

We've been covered by the <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2003/07/"
>Debian Weekly News</a> - resulting in a few more timeservers being added, the
count is at 30 now with some more having shown interest.  Amongst the latter is
also somebody in Hongkong, so the asia.time.fortytwo.ch zone will be created
shortly. I've also added a new <a
