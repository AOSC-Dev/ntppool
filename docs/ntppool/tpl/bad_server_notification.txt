Subject: NTP Pool: Problems with your NTP service ([% bad_servers.0.ip %])

Hi [% admin.username || admin.email %],

The automated NTP Pool system has marked your timeserver as either
unreachable or keeping bad time.  Until the issue has been addressed,
it will not be included in the pool.ntp.org DNS zones.

Unless you have questions then you don't need to notify me that the
problem has been resolved; the system will figure that out by itself.
(You can follow the status on the URL listed next to the server IP).
If the IP of the server changed, just reply with the new IP address.

[% FILTER repeat(70) %]-[% END %]
[%- FOR server = bad_servers %]
[% server.ip %] (current score: [% server.score %])  [% config.base_url('ntppool') %]/s/[% server.id %]
[%- END %]
[% FILTER repeat(70) %]-[% END %]

A common configuration problem (that makes ntpd crash!) is a too low
ulimit for "memory that may be locked into memory".  The easiest fix
is to add "ulimit -l 8192" to /etc/init.d/ntpd (or the equivalent file
on your system) somewhere before ntpd is started.

You can see the stats for all your servers in the pool at 
    [% config.base_url('ntppool') %]/manage


Thank you for offering your ntp service to the pool!
