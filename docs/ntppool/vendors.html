<h2>The NTP Pool for vendors</h2>

<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>
Anyone distributing an appliance, operating system or some other kind of
software using NTP.
    
<ul>
<li>Appliance vendors (Netgear, D-Link, Linksys, ...)</li>
<li>Operating System vendors (Debian, RedHat, FreeBSD, m0n0wall, ...)</li>
<li>Software vendors</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>What not to do!</h3>

<p> you must get approval from the server operator before you
hardcode any IP addresses or hostnames. This is easy to get if your own
organization runs the NTP servers you are planning to use. In most other cases
you will not get it. </p>

<p> Also, do not use the standard <b>pool.ntp.org</b> names as a default
configuration in your system. </p>

<h3>What you should do</h3>
<p>
The best solution is for your organization to setup your own cluster of NTP servers, for example ntp1.example.com, ntp2.example.com and ntp3.example.com and use those as the default in your configuration.
