	<h2>Application process for free equipment</h2>

	<p>
	If after reading the requirements you think you'll be a good recipient
	of the equipment then follow the link below to apply.  Note that you
	must have an active server in the pool system to apply.
	</p>

	<h3>Requirements for PCI cards</h3>

	<p>
	<ul class="bullet">

	<li>A reasonably clear view of the sky for the GPS antenna (if a
	handheld GPS device can lock a location then it should be okay)</li>

	<li>A Linux system with a free PCI slot</li>

	<li>Enough bandwidth to participate in the pool</li>

	<li>Plans to stay in the pool for 15 months or more.  If you leave the
	pool before 15 months we'll ask you to pass on the equipment to
	another pool member.</li>
	</ul>

	</p>

	<h3>Requirements for the LAN time server</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>You don't need a separate Linux system to run the time server, but
	it's preferred if you have at least 5Mbit bandwidth for the time
	server so we can use it as a infrastructure "hub node".
	</li>

	<li>
	If you run the lantime gps time server we'd also like to put other 
	(1U or smaller) equipment on your network to help manage the pool.
	</li>

	<li>If you stop being able to host the time server for pool use, we'll
	ask that you return it so we can get it hosted somewhere else.  In
	other words, if you volunteer to host the time server we're looking
	for extreme longevity.</li>
