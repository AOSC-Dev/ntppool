<h2>Configuration recommendations</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://ntp.isc.org/bin/view/Support/WebHome">Support
section</a> on <a href="http://ntp.isc.org/">ntp.isc.org</a> has a lot
of useful information.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.protocols.time.ntp">comp.protocols.time.ntp</a>
newsgroup is the best place to get help with the ntpd software.
</p>

<p>
Below are some things of particular importance if you are going to
join the NTP Pool with your server.
</p>

<h4>Setup about 5 servers</h4>

<p>
To work properly ntpd needs to talk to at least 3 servers ("A man with
a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure").
If you configure your ntpd with five then it'll work well even if one
or two "goes out" for an extended period.  If you configure too many
you are just wasting resources (or eventually confusing your ntpd!)
</p>

<h4>Don't use *.pool.ntp.org servers</h4>

<p>
Ironically to make sure the pool service is the best it can be you
shouldn't use the *.pool.ntp.org aliases in your configuration when
you are going to add your server to the pool.
</p>

<p>
We don't want to risk having the pool servers just sync time "amongst
themselves".  For the robustness of the pool it's healthier if all
pool operators "hand pick" good local (network wise) time servers.
The <a href="http://ntp.isc.org/bin/view/Support/WebHome">NTP
Community Site</a> maintains a <a
href="http://ntp.isc.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome">list of public
servers</a>.
</p>


<h4>Use the standard ntpd</h4>

<p>
We are all for software diversity, but a significant percentage of the
"it's not working" questions that come in are for software other than
ntpd.
</p>

<p>
You can <i>use</i> the pool with any program speaking NTP, but if you are going to join the pool we recommend you use <a href="http://ntp.isc.org/bin/view/Main/SoftwareDownloads">ntpd</a>.
</p>

<h4>Don't use the LOCAL clock driver</h4>

<p>In most scenarios it's not correct to have the LOCAL clock driver
configured.</p>

<p>You should only configure the LOCAL clock driver if you want your
ntpd to serve time to your local network in the case of a network
outage (to keep all local systems in sync even if they drift from the
UTC time).
</p>

<h3>Typical problems</h3>

<h4> "Out of memory" </h4>

<p>
Some linux distributions defaults to only allowing an application to lock 32KB memory.   An ntpd in the pool requires more than that.  In the ntpd startup script (often <tt>/etc/init.d/ntpd</tt>) add this before ntpd is started:
<blockquote>
<tt>ulimit -l 8192</tt>
</blockquote>


</p>

<h4>RHEL4 x86_64 configuration</h4>

<p>
There's a <a
href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=158541">known
problem</a> with the x86_64 package in RHEL4 U2.  There's a link to an
updated .src.rpm in that bug posting.  (Or you can download a build
rpm: <a href="http://tmp.askask.com/2006/01/ntp-4.2.0.a.20050816-10.x86_64.rpm"
>ntp-4.2.0.a.20050816-10.x86_64.rpm</a> (no warranty, etc etc).
