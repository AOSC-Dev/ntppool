<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
I created this project after a <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3E2DBFF7.F9A51614%40udel.edu"
>discussion</a> about resource consumption on the big timeservers, with the
idea that for everyday use a DNS round robin would be good enough, and would
allow spreading the load over many servers. The disadvantage is, of course,
that you may occasionally get a bad server (if so, please report it to the <a
href="mailto:timekeepers@fortytwo.ch"
>timekeepers mailing list</a>, see <a href="#mail">below</a>) and that you
usually won't get the server closest to you.
</p>
<p>
I originally started this project as the <em>time.fortytwo.ch</em> project in
my own domain, but David Mills (he who is ntp) thought the idea was good enough
to be tried, so the project soon moved to the <em>pool.ntp.org</em> domain.

pool.ntp.org project <i>[2004-12-15: Versions later than 3.6.1 do now properly

now uses simple ntp queries instead of 'ntpd' monitoring servers.

that bad timeservers are automatically removed from the pool.ntp.org
nameserver (an associated <a href="#mail">mailing list</a> has also been
created). Richard S. Shuford (Sun) sent me a note about how to configure nscd
properly to work around the fact that it doesn't do proper round robin of DNS

It's done!  The project is now at pool.ntp.org.  Also, country level subdomain
are being created - the biggest (us) already has 18 servers, with ch (11) and
nl (8) being the next biggest.  Due to a problem with TCP nameserver requests,
no more than 15 servers are visible at any moment in the zone.  Debian
developer Bdale Garbee considers using pool.ntp.org in the default
configuration of the Debian ntp package.  Read the longer version of these news

<h2><a name="use">How do I use pool.ntp.org?</a></h2>
<p>
If you just want to synchronise your computers clock to the network, the
configuration file (for the ntpd program from the <a
href="http://www.ntp.org">ntp.org distribution</a>, on any supported operating
system - <b>Linux, *BSD, Windows and even some more exotic systems</b>) is
really simple:
</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift

server 0.pool.ntp.org
server 1.pool.ntp.org
server 2.pool.ntp.org
</pre>
<p>
The 0, 1 and 2.pool.ntp.org names point to a random set of servers that will
change every hour.  Make sure your computer's clock is set to something
sensible (within a few minutes of the 'true' time) - you could use <tt>ntpdate
pool.ntp.org</tt>, or you could just use the <tt>date</tt> command and set it
to your wristwatch. Start ntpd, and after some time (this could take as long as
half an hour!), <tt>ntpq -pn</tt> should output something like:
</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
avbidder:~$ ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
+81.6.42.224     193.5.216.14     2 u   68 1024  377  158.995   51.220  50.287
*217.162.232.173 130.149.17.8     2 u  191 1024  176   79.245    3.589  27.454
-129.132.57.95   131.188.3.222    3 u  766 1024  377   22.302   -2.928   0.508
</pre> 
<p>
The IP addresses will be different, because you've been assigned random
timeservers. The essential thing is that one of the lines starts with an
asterisk (<tt>*</tt>), this means your computer gets the time from the internet
- you'll never have to worry about it again!
</p>
<p>
As <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> will assign you timeservers from all over the
world, time quality will not be ideal.  You get a bit better result if you use
the continental zones (europe, north-america, oceania and asia.pool.ntp.org
currently exist), and even better time if you use the country zone (like
ch.pool.ntp.org in Switzerland) - for all these zones, you can again use the 0,
1 or 2 prefixes, like 0.ch.pool.ntp.org.  Note, however, that the country zone
might not exist for your country, or might contain only one or two timeservers.
If you know timeservers that are really close to you (measured by network
distance, with <tt>traceroute</tt> or <tt>ping</tt>), time probably will be
even better.
</p>
<p>
If you're using <b>a recent Windows version</b>, you can also use the ntp
client that is built into the system. Just execute:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
net time /setsntp:pool.ntp.org
</pre>
<p>
at the command prompt. This is known to work on Windows 2000/XP/2003.  The same
can be achieved by, as administrator, right-clicking the clock in the taskbar,
selecting 'Adjust Date/Time' and entering the server name in the 'Internet Time'
tab.
</p>
<div>
Additional notes:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
If you have a static IP address and a reasonable Internet connection (bandwidth
is not so important, but it should be stable and not too highly loaded), please
consider donating your server to the server pool. It doesn't cost you more than
a few hundred bytes per second traffic, but you help this project survive.
Please <a href="#join">see below</a> for more information.
</li>
<li>
If your Internet provider has a timeserver, or if you know of a good timeserver
near you, you should use that and not this list - you'll probably get better
time and you'll use fewer network resources.  If you know only one timeserver
near you, you can of course use that and two from pool.ntp.org or so.
</li>
<li>
It can rarely happen that you are assigned the same timeserver twice - just
restarting the ntp server usually solves this problem.  If you use a country
zone, please note that it may be because there is only one server known in the
project - better use a continental zone in that case.
</li>
<li>
Be friendly. Many servers are provided by volunteers, and almost all time
servers are really file or mail or webservers which just happen to also run ntp.
So don't use more than three time servers in your configuration, and don't play
dirty tricks with <tt>burst</tt> or <tt>minpoll</tt> - all you will gain is
that this project will be stopped sooner or later.
</li>
<li>
Make sure that the <i>time zone configuration</i> of your computer is correct.
ntpd itself does not do anything about the time zones, it just uses UTC
internally.
</li>
<li>
If you are synchronising a network to pool.ntp.org, please set up one of your
computers as a time server and synchronize the other computers to that one.
(you'll have some reading to do - it's not difficult though. And there's always
the <a href="news:comp.protocols.time.ntp"
>comp.protocols.time.ntp newsgroup</a>.)
</li>
<li>
At this point, I'd like to thank those donating their time and timeservers to
this network.
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:right"><a href="#top">go up</a></div>
<h2><a name="join">How do I join pool.ntp.org?</a></h2>
<p>
Your computer <b>must have a static IP address</b> and a permanent internet
connection. The required bandwidth is really low (2 packets per client and
minute is about the maximum you'll get. The project steadily acquires more
timeservers, so the load should distribute pretty evenly, with only few clients
for each server). Then, I assume that you already are running a timeserver and
have it synchronised to some time source. If this is all ok, you can write an
email to <a href="mailto:clockmaster@fortytwo.ch"
>clockmaster@fortytwo.ch</a> to tell me that you'd like to join and in which
country your server is. I'd ask you to also subscribe to the <a
href="mailto:timekeepers-announce-request@fortytwo.ch?subject=subscribe"
>timekeepers-announce@fortytwo.ch</a> mailing list so you keep up with newest
developments (I try to keep the mail volume down at around one message per
month).
</p>
<p>
The servers joining should not have <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> as their upstream
server(s), but should configure some good servers manually (those servers
<b>may</b> be chosen from the pool. The point is that they are chosen
statically instead of assigned randomly at each server restart.  This will help
providing an acceptable quality of service.)  Note that it is not required that
your server is a stratum 1 or 2 server - as this project is about load
distribution mostly, there is no reason why a stratum 3 or even stratum 4
server shouldn't join.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice (but it's not necessary) if you could redirect web requests
on port 80 of your time server to the official web page of the project at
<tt>http://www.pool.ntp.org</tt>. If you run Apache, you could do this with:
</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName pool.ntp.org
    ServerAlias *.pool.ntp.org
    Redirect permanent / http://www.pool.ntp.org/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Again, this is only if you run a webserver anyway. The official project web 
page will always be given with the 'www' at the beginning - but sometimes
people are lazy and just type <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> and are then surprised
to just get a random web page.
</p>
<p>
Once I have confirmed the server's addition to the pool, the server is
constantly monitored for quality, using a scoring algorithm described in <a
href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/pipermail/timekeepers-announce/2003/000006.html"
>this email</a>.  You can watch your server's performance using the <a
href="scores">web frontend</a>, but please do not use this for automated
queries - my server is not a big machine and I don't want to restrict access to
this page because the load goes through the roof.
</p>
<div style="text-align:right"><a href="#top">go up</a></div>
<h2><a name="mail">The mailing lists</a></h2>
<p>
Currently, there are three mailing lists for the pool.ntp.org project: the
discussion list <a
href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/timekeepers"
>timekeepers@fortytwo.ch</a> (<a
href="mailto:timekeepers-request@fortytwo.ch?subject=subscribe" >subscribe</a>,
<a href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/pipermail/timekeepers/" >archive</a>),
the announcement list <a
href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/timekeepers-announce"
>timekeepers-announce@fortytwo.ch</a> (<a
href="mailto:timekeepers-announce-request@fortytwo.ch?subject=subscribe"
>subscribe</a>,
<a href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/pipermail/timekeepers-announce/"
>archive</a>) and the bulletins list <a
href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/timekeepers-bulletin"
>timekeepers-bulletin@fortytwo.ch</a> (<a
href="mailto:timekeepers-bulletin-request@fortytwo.ch?subject=subscribe"
>subscribe</a>, <a
href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/pipermail/timekeepers-bulletin">archive</a>).
The discussion list is, of course, mainly for those interested in the project,
while the announcements list is intended for server operators (or users of the
pool.ntp.org service) who do not wish to be more deeply involved with the
development and maintenance of the project. <i>There is no need to subscribe to
both lists - announcements will be sent to both lists</i> (if I don't forget
it, that is). Of course, general discussions about ntp should take place on the
<a href="news:comp.protocols.time.ntp">comp.protocols.time.ntp</a> Usenet
newsgroup.
