<p>
First: Thanks for your interest.  Usage of the pool has grown
enormously and the only way we can keep it easy for everyone to run a
pool server is to also grow the number of servers participating.
</p>

<p>
Your computer <b>must have a static IP address</b> and a permanent
internet connection.  It's very imporant that your IP address doesn't
change or only does so extremely infrequently (say once a year or
less).  The required bandwidth is relatively low.  Each client will
only send a couple of UDP packets every few to every 20 minutes.
</p>

<p>
Currently most servers get about 5-10 NTP packets per second with
spikes a couple of times a day of 15-20 packets per second.  This is
roughly equivalent to 10-20Kbit/sec with spikes of 30-40Kbit/sec.  The
project steadily acquires more timeservers, so the load should not
increase dramatically for each server.  It was going up for a while,
but the last few months (as of September 2005) it has actually been
going down.
</p>

<p>

Here are a few servers with traffic/load graphs (go to the bottom of
the page for the links): [% i = 0; FOR server = combust.servers_with_urls; %]
<a href="/scores?ip=[% server.ip %]">[% i=i+1; i %]</a>
[% END %]

</p>

<p>
The servers joining should not have <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> as their upstream
server(s), but should configure some <a href="http://ntp.isc.org/bin/view/Servers/StratumTwoTimeServers">good servers</a> manually (those servers
<b>may</b> be chosen from the pool. The point is that they are chosen
statically instead of assigned randomly at each server restart.  This
will help providing an acceptable quality of service.)

Note that it is not required that your server is a stratum 1 or 2
server - as this project is about load distribution mostly, there is
no reason why a stratum 3 or even stratum 4 server shouldn't join.
</p>

<p>
Some default installations of ntpd aren't configured for the number of
clients you'll get by being in the pool.  The symptom is that your
ntpd will crash(!).  The problem is that one of the ulimit settings is
too low.  On one of my servers exhibiting this problem I fixed it by
adding <tt>ulimit -l 8192</tt> to <tt>/etc/init.d/ntpd</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If this is all ok, login to the
<a href="/manage">server management</a> page and request your server to be added. 
If you have any trouble with the system, email me at <a
href="mailto:ask@develooper.com">ask@develooper.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'd ask you to also subscribe to the <a
href="mailto:timekeepers-announce-request@fortytwo.ch?subject=subscribe"
>timekeepers-announce@fortytwo.ch</a> mailing list so you keep up with newest
developments (I try to keep the mail volume down at around one message per
month).
</p>
<p>
It would be nice (but it's not necessary) if you could redirect web requests
on port 80 of your time server to the official web page of the project at
<tt>http://www.pool.ntp.org</tt>. If you run Apache, you could do this with:
</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName pool.ntp.org
    ServerAlias *.pool.ntp.org
    Redirect permanent / http://www.pool.ntp.org/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Again, this is only if you run a webserver anyway. The official project web 
page will always be given with the 'www' at the beginning - but sometimes
people are lazy and just type <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> and are then surprised
to just get a random web page.
</p>
<p>
Once I have confirmed the server's addition to the pool, the server is
constantly monitored for quality, using a scoring algorithm described in <a
href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/pipermail/timekeepers-announce/2003/000006.html"
>this email</a>.  You can watch your server's performance using the <a
href="scores">web frontend</a> or the <a href="/manage">management page</a>.
