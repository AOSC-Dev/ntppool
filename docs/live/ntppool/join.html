<p>
Your computer <b>must have a static IP address</b> and a permanent internet
connection. The required bandwidth is really low (2 packets per client and
minute is about the maximum you'll get. The project steadily acquires more
timeservers, so the load should distribute pretty evenly, with only few clients
for each server). Then, I assume that you already are running a timeserver and
have it synchronised to some time source. If this is all ok, login to the
<a href="/manage">server management</a> page and request your server to be added. 
If you have any trouble with the system, email me at <a
href="mailto:ask@develooper.com">ask@develooper.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'd ask you to also subscribe to the <a
href="mailto:timekeepers-announce-request@fortytwo.ch?subject=subscribe"
>timekeepers-announce@fortytwo.ch</a> mailing list so you keep up with newest
developments (I try to keep the mail volume down at around one message per
month).
</p>
<p>
The servers joining should not have <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> as their upstream
server(s), but should configure some good servers manually (those servers
<b>may</b> be chosen from the pool. The point is that they are chosen
statically instead of assigned randomly at each server restart.  This will help
providing an acceptable quality of service.)  Note that it is not required that
your server is a stratum 1 or 2 server - as this project is about load
distribution mostly, there is no reason why a stratum 3 or even stratum 4
server shouldn't join.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice (but it's not necessary) if you could redirect web requests
on port 80 of your time server to the official web page of the project at
<tt>http://www.pool.ntp.org</tt>. If you run Apache, you could do this with:
</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName pool.ntp.org
    ServerAlias *.pool.ntp.org
    Redirect permanent / http://www.pool.ntp.org/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Again, this is only if you run a webserver anyway. The official project web 
page will always be given with the 'www' at the beginning - but sometimes
people are lazy and just type <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> and are then surprised
to just get a random web page.
</p>
<p>
Once I have confirmed the server's addition to the pool, the server is
constantly monitored for quality, using a scoring algorithm described in <a
href="https://fortytwo.ch/mailman/pipermail/timekeepers-announce/2003/000006.html"
>this email</a>.  You can watch your server's performance using the <a
href="scores">web frontend</a> or the <a href="/manage">management page</a>.
