Subject: NTP Pool: Problems with your NTP service ([% bad_servers.0.ip %])

Hi [% admin.username || admin.email %],

Because your timeserver is being detected as either unreachable or bad, your
timeserver is not being included in the pool.ntp.org DNS zones.

Please solve the problem or notify me of the new IP address of your server.

[% FILTER repeat(70) %]-[% END %]
[%- FOR server = bad_servers %]
[% server.ip %] (current score: [% server.score %])
[%- END %]
[% FILTER repeat(70) %]-[% END %]

A common configuration problem (that makes ntpd crash!) is a too low
ulimit for "memory that may be locked into memory".  The easiest fix
is to add "ulimit -l 8092" to /etc/init.d/ntpd (or the equivalent file
on your system) somewhere before ntpd is started.

You can see the stats for all your servers in the pool at 
    [% config.base_url('ntppool') %]/manage


Thank you for offering your ntp service to the pool!

  - ask

ps. These email alerts are still in testing, so please let me know if
you have any suggestions or find any errors.  :)
