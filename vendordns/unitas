Hi,

I'm currently experimenting with NTP in our application. We're a  
small ISV developing customs declaration software (in the  
Netherlands) and air and sea logistics management software  
(worldwide). I would like to use a pool of (mostly/only European)  
servers. The number of client applications is less than 1000, and  
will likely remain so for at least another two years.


My SNTP client implementation is not complete yet, but I will  
implement KoD before initial public release. The accuracy our  
application needs is roughly 5-30 seconds, I guess polling once every  
three days would be enough. However, as our application runs on  
desktop PCs, restarted daily, it will likely follow euro business  
hours (as people start their machines in the CET morning, and I  
probably won't be able to adjust the PC hardware clock itself).



To mitigate NTP server load, and increase inter-application accuracy  
(more important than absolute accuracy), clients will mostly sync  
among each other. I still have to implement that, too.

We don't own a colo-machine at the moment, when that changes I am  
quite willing to add a stratum 2+ server to the pool.

The Big Question is - do we need a vendor pool, or can I just use  
x.europe.pool.ntp.org and promise to contact you again when the  
number of clients grows bigger? Or is there some other way to  
announce my application (using the reference ID in the request packets).
