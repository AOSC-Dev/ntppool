RT#748 - http://rt.develooper.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=748

Hi,

we develop and sell internet security, mail and groupware appliances  
("Intranator" brand). Our systems include an ntp deamon (openntpd)  
for local system time but also for use as time source in the LAN of  
the customer.

Currently our system is only available in german localisation and is  
only sold in Germany, Austria and Swiss. We already have sold about  
1000 systems. We plan to sell an english version throughout europe in  
the next year.

Currently these systems come configured with 0.de.pool.ntp.org to  
2.de...

I just read that this is bad practice and we should switch to a  
vendor zone. I hereby request a vendor zone, preferrably  
intra2net.pool.ntp.org.
We can switch our customers to the new zone using our update  
technology. Our customers usually apply updates within 3 month so the  
usage of the old zone can be dropped quickly.

Currently we use the de pool to give our customers servers that are  
nearby. Is this possible with vendor zones too? Like  
0.de.intra2net.pool.ntp.org or at least with the regions like  
0.europe.intra2net.pool.ntp.org and 0.asia.intra2net.pool.ntp.org.

Kind regards,

Gerd
