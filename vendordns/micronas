Hello,

I am writing to request assignment of vendor-specific hostnames to  
provide pooled NTP service for the Micronas USA System-on-Chip  
reference designs.  These hostnames would be used as the default NTP  
servers for the Linux SDK that is shipped to ODMs who design consumer  
products based on these chips.  The number of such devices that  
Micronas USA ships would remain small; almost certainly fewer than  
1000 would be online at any given time.  (However, we cannot  
guarantee that ODMs will change the NTP server names when creating  
retail products.)

If possible, please use the vendor name "micronas" when creating  
these hostnames.

Thank you.  -Nathan
