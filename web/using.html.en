<h2>How do I use pool.ntp.org?</h2>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Please read this page before you use pool.ntp.org as your
time source.  The project exists thanks to the effort of more than 100
volounteers all over the world, and abusing the resources of this project may
cause this service to be discontinued.
</p>
<p>
All time servers in the project are collected in the main
<tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> DNS name.  To improve reliability,
<tt>0.pool.ntp.org</tt>, <tt>1.pool.ntp.org</tt> and <tt>2.pool.ntp.org</tt>
have also been created; they also contain all servers in the pool.  (This is,
technically, not entirely accurate: to limit the size of a nameserver query,
each of these DNS names does only contain a random sample of 15 time servers at
any time.  This set is changed every hour, so that the load is distributed
roughly evenly over all time servers in the pool.)
</p>
<p>
To lessen the impact of long distances in the Internet, regional and
per-country time server pools have also been created: the regional pools are
<tt>europe.pool.ntp.org</tt>, <tt>asia.pool.ntp.org</tt>,
<tt>north-america.pool.ntp.org</tt>, <tt>south-america.pool.ntp.org</tt> and
<tt>oceania.pool.ntp.org</tt>.  The per-country pools are called
<tt>xx.pool.ntp.org</tt>, where xx is the two letter code of your country, as
it is used in Internet addresses - for example, time servers in Switzerland are
collected in ch.pool.ntp.org and time servers in Brazil in br.pool.ntp.org.
Note that these pools do not exist for all countries (if you do not know if a
pool exists for your country, simply use the global pools.  You should never
notice the difference unitl you seriously need microsecond-precise time
synchronization - and then, the pool.ntp.org project isn't the right thing for
you anyway.)  As with the global pool 0, 1 and 2.xx.pool.ntp.org exist
additionally to provide more reliable service.
</p>
<p>
If your Internet provider has a timeserver, or if you know of a good timeserver
near you, you should use that and not this list - you'll probably get better
time and you'll use fewer network resources.  If you know only one timeserver
near you, you can of course use that and two from pool.ntp.org or so.
</p>
<p>
If <b>you are synchronising a network to pool.ntp.org</b>, please set up one of
your computers as a time server and synchronize the other computers to that
one.  If <b>you plan to synchronzie more than just a few computers to the
pool.ntp.org project,</b> read the section on mass-deployments <a
href="#deploy">at the end of this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
If <b>you have a static IP address</b> and a reasonable Internet connection
(bandwidth is not so important, but it should be stable and not too highly
loaded), please consider donating your server to the server pool. It doesn't
cost you more than a few hundred bytes per second traffic, but you help this
project survive.  Please <a href="/#join">see the relevant documentation</a>
for more information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Be friendly.</b>  Many servers are provided by volounteers, and almost all
time servers are really file or mail or webservers which just happen to also
run ntp.  So don't use more than three time servers in your configuration, and
don't query the servers unnecessarily often - your only gain is that this
project will have to be stopped sooner or later.
</p>
<p>
Make sure that the <b>time zone configuration</b> of your computer is correct -
if your computer's time is wrong by a number of hours, it's usually not the
time servers' fault.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I'd like to thank those donating their time and timeservers to
this network.

<h3>Using pool.ntp.org with your platform</h3>
Below are instructions to synchronize your computer to the pool with various
ntp clients.
<h4>The original ntpd</h4>






---------- TODO -----------








<p>
If you just want to synchronise your computers clock to the network, the
configuration file (for the ntpd program from the <a
href="http://www.ntp.org">ntp.org distribution</a>, on any supported operating
system - <b>Linux, *BSD, Windows and even some more exotic systems</b>) is
really simple:
</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift

server 0.pool.ntp.org
server 1.pool.ntp.org
server 2.pool.ntp.org
</pre>
<p>
The 0, 1 and 2.pool.ntp.org names point to a random set of servers that will
change every hour.  Make sure your computer's clock is set to something
sensible (within a few minutes of the 'true' time) - you could use <tt>ntpdate
pool.ntp.org</tt>, or you could just use the <tt>date</tt> command and set it
to your wristwatch. Start ntpd, and after some time (this could take as long as
half an hour!), <tt>ntpq -pn</tt> should output something like:
</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
avbidder:~$ ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
+81.6.42.224     193.5.216.14     2 u   68 1024  377  158.995   51.220  50.287
*217.162.232.173 130.149.17.8     2 u  191 1024  176   79.245    3.589  27.454
-129.132.57.95   131.188.3.222    3 u  766 1024  377   22.302   -2.928   0.508
</pre> 
<p>
The IP addresses will be different, because you've been assigned random
timeservers. The essential thing is that one of the lines starts with an
asterisk (<tt>*</tt>), this means your computer gets the time from the internet
- you'll never have to worry about it again!
</p>
<p>
As <tt>pool.ntp.org</tt> will assign you timeservers from all over the
world, time quality will not be ideal.  You get a bit better result if you use
the continental zones (europe, north-america, oceania and asia.pool.ntp.org
currently exist), and even better time if you use the country zone (like
ch.pool.ntp.org in Switzerland) - for all these zones, you can again use the 0,
1 or 2 prefixes, like 0.ch.pool.ntp.org.  Note, however, that the country zone
might not exist for your country, or might contain only one or two timeservers.
If you know timeservers that are really close to you (measured by network
distance, with <tt>traceroute</tt> or <tt>ping</tt>), time probably will be
even better.
</p>
<p>
If you're using <b>a recent Windows version</b>, you can also use the ntp
client that is built into the system. Just execute:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#e0e0e0;">
net time /setsntp:pool.ntp.org
</pre>
<p>
at the command prompt. This is known to work on Windows 2000/XP/2003.  The same
can be achieved by, as administrator, right-clicking the clock in the taskbar,
selecting 'Adjust Date/Time' and entering the server name in the 'Internet Time'
tab.

Additional notes:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
If you have a static IP address and a reasonable Internet connection (bandwidth
is not so important, but it should be stable and not too highly loaded), please
consider donating your server to the server pool. It doesn't cost you more than
a few hundred bytes per second traffic, but you help this project survive.
Please <a href="#join">see below</a> for more information.
</li>
<li>
If your Internet provider has a timeserver, or if you know of a good timeserver
near you, you should use that and not this list - you'll probably get better
time and you'll use fewer network resources.  If you know only one timeserver
near you, you can of course use that and two from pool.ntp.org or so.
</li>
<li>
It can rarely happen that you are assigned the same timeserver twice - just
restarting the ntp server usually solves this problem.  If you use a country
zone, please note that it may be because there is only one server known in the
project - better use a continental zone in that case.
</li>
<li>
Be friendly. Many servers are provided by volounteers, and almost all time
servers are really file or mail or webservers which just happen to also run ntp.
So don't use more than three time servers in your configuration, and don't play
dirty tricks with <tt>burst</tt> or <tt>minpoll</tt> - all you will gain is
that this project will be stopped sooner or later.
</li>
<li>
Make sure that the <i>time zone configuration</i> of your computer is correct.
ntpd itself does not do anything about the time zones, it just uses UTC
internally.
</li>
<li>
If you are synchronising a network to pool.ntp.org, please set up one of your
computers as a time server and synchronize the other computers to that one.
(you'll have some reading to do - it's not difficult though. And there's always
the <a href="news:comp.protocols.time.ntp"
>comp.protocols.time.ntp newsgroup</a>.)
</li>
<li>
At this point, I'd like to thank those donating their time and timeservers to
this network.
